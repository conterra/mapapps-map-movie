# Map Movie App Template
This app template allows you to create really cool apps, that show different maps in a nice filmstrip to a user. A user can run the "map movie" automatically or cross-fade maps manually.

The template also shows a prototype of a new way of configuring an app (by clicking different elements in the template to configure them). Your own map services can be added to the app in a very easy way (restriction is, that you use tiled services in EPSG:3857). You need map.apps 3.2.0 to use this template.
